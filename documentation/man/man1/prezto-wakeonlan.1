.PP
This module provides a wrapper around the wakeonlan
.UR http://gsd.di.uminho.pt/jpo/software/wakeonlan/
.UE
tool.
.SH Usage
.PP
To use this wrapper, create the \fI~/.wakeonlan\fP directory, and place in it one
file for each device you would like to be able to wake. Give the file a name
that describes the device, such as its hostname.
.PP
Each file should contain a line with the MAC address of the target device and
the network broadcast address. For instance, there might be a file
\fI~/.wakeonlan/leto\fP with the following contents:
.nf
00:11:22:33:44:55:66 192.168.0.255
.fi
.PP
To wake that device, use the following command:
.nf
wake leto
.fi
.PP
