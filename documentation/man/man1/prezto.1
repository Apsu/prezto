.TH Prezto â€” Instantly Awesome Zsh
.PP
Prezto is the configuration framework for Zsh
.UR http://www.zsh.org
.UE ; it enriches the command line
interface environment with sane defaults, aliases, functions, auto completion,
and prompt themes.
.SH Installation
.PP
Prezto will work with any recent release of Zsh, but the minimum recommended
version is 4.3.10.

.SS Mac OS X
.PP
If you have administrator privileges, you must fix an Apple\-introduced problem
in Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard by executing the following command, or BASH and Zsh
will have the wrong \fB\fCPATH\fR when executed non\-interactively.
.nf
sudo chmod ugo-x /usr/libexec/path_helper
.fi
.PP
\fB\fCpath_helper\fR is intended to make it easier for installers to add new paths to
the environment without having to edit shell configuration files by adding
a file with a path to the \fI/etc/paths.d\fP directory.
.PP
Unfortunately, \fB\fCpath_helper\fR always reads paths from \fI/etc/paths\fP set by Apple
then paths from \fI/etc/paths.d\fP set by third party installers, and lastly paths
from the \fB\fCPATH\fR environment variable set by the parent process, which
ultimately is set by the user with \fB\fCexport PATH=...\fR Thus, it reorders path
priorities, and user \fI/bin\fP directories meant to override system \fI/bin\fP
directories end up at the tail of the array.
.SS Troubleshooting
.PP
If you are not able to find certain commands after switching to \fIPrezto\fP,
modify the \fB\fCPATH\fR variable in \fI~/.zshenv\fP then open a new Zsh terminal
window or tab.

accompanying README files to learn of what is available.
